# Food-Ordering-and-Billing-System
This project presents a comprehensive Food Ordering and Billing System in Python with integrated user authentication to ensure secure access. The system simulates a multi-restaurant food ordering interface, allowing users to browse menus from six different outlets including Veg Street, Mandi, McDonald's, KFC, Brew Buzz, and Starbucks. Each restaurant features a unique set of menu items with corresponding prices.

Users can log in or sign up through a secure login system utilizing MD5 hashing for password encryption and credential storage. Once authenticated, users can select items, specify quantities, and view real-time billing across multiple categories. A final invoice includes user details, billing date, address, phone number validation, and choice of payment via cash or card. The billing section calculates total cost, handles cash/card transactions, and confirms the order.

This project combines concepts of file handling, modular programming, data validation, user interaction, and basic cryptography, offering an excellent demonstration of real-world billing systems. The program is highly interactive and relies on a recursive approach to allow multi-category ordering before final billing.

The system promotes fundamental understanding of Pythonâ€™s control structures, data structures, and function design, and it is well-suited for beginner to intermediate-level learners seeking hands-on experience in developing functional CLI-based applications with authentication and data processing.
